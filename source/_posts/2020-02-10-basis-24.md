At the same time, the Party is targeting raising the country's profile beyond a low-cost labor destination to a center for science and technology.<br /><br />With more than a dozen free trade agreements now under its belt, Vietnam aims to expand and diversify export markets, the Party said.<br /><br />The country has reaped the benefit of China and the US, its largest trading partners, being locked in a bitter trade war that has seen Western manufacturers look to move more and more of their production out of China - with Vietnam a popular choice.<br /><br />Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong - reselected to serve a rare third term as Party chief on Sunday - said Vietnam would aim to be a fully developed country by 2045, and that an ongoing crackdown on corruption across Party ranks would continue.<br /><br />Reuters <br>
