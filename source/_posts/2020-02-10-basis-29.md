(Xinhua/Zulkarnain) </p>Indonesia's air accident investigator has sent five components of a crashed Sriwijaya Air jet to the US and the UK for examination, including the autothrottle that controls engine power automatically, the agency's head said on Tuesday.<br><br>The 26-year-old Boeing Co 737-500 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on January 9, killing all 62 people on board.<br><br>National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters the components had been sent for examination to help find out why an autothrottle parameter had changed.<br><br>He did not identify the other parts of the plane.<br><br>The plane's flight data recorder (FDR) has been found and read by investigators, but a maritime search is going on for the cockpit voice recorder's (CVR) memory unit that Tjahjono said would help explain any human factors behind the crash.<br><br>"If we only have the FDR, we do not know why the parameter changed, what was the reason," he said of the autothrottle.<br><br>"We need confirmation from the components that we sent to the US and UK and the CVR," Tjahjono noted.<br><br>KNKT said in January it was investigating whether a problem with the autothrottle system contributed to the crash given an issue with it had been reported on a flight a few days earlier.<br><br>It is acceptable for a plane to fly with an autothrottle system that is not working because pilots can control it manually instead.<br><br>KNKT plans to issue a preliminary report into the crash soon, possibly on February 9, Tjahjono said.<br><br>Reuters <br>
