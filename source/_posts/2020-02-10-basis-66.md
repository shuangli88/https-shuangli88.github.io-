<p class="picture" style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Photo: screenshot from the video circulating online</p><br />A video of a woman recording an outdoor aerobics video in Myanmar on Monday morning without realizing that military vehicles were driving to the parliament building has gone viral, sparking heated discussions over its authenticity.<br /><br />Myanmar's leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior officials, were detained by the military on Monday. Myanmar's military later announced a state of emergency and said power had been handed to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.<br /><br />A video clip circulating online shows the woman, dressed in sportswear and wearing a mask, doing aerobics in front of the camera out in the open, as military vehicles pass by behind her. She seemed to be unaware of the vehicles and continued doing her exercise.<br /><br />Some netizens discovered that the location where she recorded the video was at a roundabout not far from the Myanmar parliament.<br /><br />The video triggered heated discussions on the internet. The hashtag "Myanmar woman records military vehicles driving to parliament building while doing aerobics" became one of the top topics on China's Sina Weibo, and was viewed over 70 million times as of press time.<br /><br />Some sharp-eyed netizens saw that the shadow of the woman's legs are visible while the upper part was not, sparking discussions on the authenticity of the video.<br /><br />Some insisted that the video is real, arguing that the shadow of the upper part of her body disappeared simply because she was dancing on a step. Others believed the video was created using special techniques, and could have been shot in front of a green screen.<br /><br />"The step would skew or cover a part of the body's shadow, but it is impossible that the entire upper body was not there," one Chinese netizen commented.<br /><br />For some netizens, it would have been impossible for the scene to take place, as the military would have cleared the area beforehand. However, others claimed that it is normal that the woman was completely unaware of what was going on, as the incident happened quickly and secretly.<br /><br />Many Chinese netizens were still amazed by the woman's focused attitude and the rare coincidence.<br /><br />"A thumbs-up for the mask!" a Chinese netizen Xu Jingcheng commented.<br /><br />"I have to say this is learner-friendly, and the background music is quite nice," another said.<br /><br />The entire video lasted about three and a half minutes, with military vehicles appearing halfway through it. It was originally posted on Facebook by the woman herself, who is identified as Khing Hnin Wai, a physical education teacher. It won her 19,000 comments and 13,000 shares.<br /><br />The woman has not yet answered questions from netizens as of press time, but uploaded several more videos of her doing aerobics at the same site in response.<br /><br /> <br>
