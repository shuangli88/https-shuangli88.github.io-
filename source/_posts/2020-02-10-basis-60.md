His family said they were with him on Monday night during the last hours of his life. <br /><br />"The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of." said the family statement. <br /><br />Moore, who turned 100 last April, raised more than 32 million pounds (about 43.65 million US dollars) for Britian's National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his garden during the country's first COVID lockdown last year. <br /><br />His fundraising efforts won the country's hearts and he was knighted by the Queen in July. <br /><br />A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Tuesday that the Queen sent private message of condolence to the family of Tom Moore. <br /><br />

He was a great British hero that showed the best of our country and I send my best wishes to his family at this time." <br /><br />Number 10 Downing Street will lower the flag to half mast in tribute to him, reported the BBC. <br /><br />Moore passed away as the total number of coronavirus cases in the country stood at 3,852,623 on Tuesday. The anti-COVID fight he backed last year is still going on in Britain. <br /><br />England is currently under the third national lockdown since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country. Similar restriction measures are also in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia and the United States have been racing against time to roll out coronavirus vaccines. <br>
