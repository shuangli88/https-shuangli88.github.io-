"I would expect that, if this package is passed, that we would get back to full employment next year." <br /><br />Citing a recent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, Yellen said the US unemployment rate is going to "stay elevated for years to come" without additional support. <br /><br />"It would take until 2025 in order to get the unemployment rate down to 4 percent again," she said. <br /><br />US employers added just 49,000 jobs in January, after slashing downwardly revised 227,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department reported Friday. <br /><br />The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell by 0.4 percentage point to 6.3 percent in January, still well above the pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent in February 2020. <br /><br />Yellen also downplayed the potential inflation risk from the 1.9-trillion-dollar COVID-19 relief package. <br /><br />"My predecessor has indicated that there's a chance that this will cause inflation to rise. And that's also a risk that we have to consider. I have spent many years studying inflation and worrying about inflation," said the treasury secretary. <br /><br />"We have the tools to deal with that risk if it materializes. But we face a huge economic challenge here and tremendous suffering in the country. We have got to address that. That's the biggest risk," she added. <br /><br />Yellen's remarks came after both chambers of US Congress on Friday passed a budget resolution, a key step which would allow Democrats to push through Biden's relief package without Republican support. <br /><br />"We need a big package. And we need to get this done quickly. And those are the things that the president is really committed to," she said. <br>
