<p class="picture" style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Times New Roman; color: #999; margin-top: 3px">Biden Photo: CFP</p>US President Joe Biden on Saturday launched a series of conversations with ordinary Americans by calling a woman who lost her job due to the pandemic, in an effort to showcase his direct contact with his fellow citizens.<br /><br />"The White House will launch a new effort for the president to regularly communicate directly with the American people," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday.<br /><br />Due to COVID-19, the conversation was held via telephone from the Oval Office in Washington to Michele, a mother from Roseville, California who lost her job at a start-up company because of the economic crisis sparked by the pandemic.<br /><br />She had written to Biden to tell him about her struggles and her search for a new job.<br /><br />"Like my dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity, it's about your respect, it's about your place in the community," the 78-year-old president told Michele, in a video of the call posted online by the White House.<br /><br />Biden also took the opportunity to promote his $1.9 trillion stimulus package that his Democratic party is preparing to adopt in Congress, despite the lack of Republican support, as well as the massive vaccination campaign he has promised.<br /><br />"We're so glad that we have you focusing on that," said Michele, whose last name was withheld, adding that her parents had just made their appointment to get their COVID-19 vaccinations.<br /><br />With this new conversation series, Biden is seeking to show his empathy - and to mark a break from his predecessor Donald Trump, who was accused by critics of not caring about the fate of millions of Americans affected by America's health and economic crises.<br /><br />Biden's phone calls are meant to be a modern-day iteration, in the era of social media, of the radio fireside chats held by president Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s as a way to invite himself into American homes.<br /><br />Trump only sporadically took up this tradition, in the form of pre-recorded videos published on Facebook.<br /><br />Biden on Friday seized on feeble US employment data to argue the world's largest economy needs his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.<br /><br />The closely watched jobs data showed the unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in January, but the economy added only 49,000 jobs, the Labor Department said.<br /><br />The anemic report made plain the ongoing struggles in the US as Americans cope with the largest COVID-19 outbreak in the world.<br /><br />"I believe the American people are looking right now to their government for help," Biden said after a meeting with top Democratic lawmakers.<br /><br />Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would push for rapid approval of the package.<br /><br />"Hopefully in a two-week period of time, we'll send something over to the Senate," she told reporters.<br /><br />The House of Representatives approved a budget proposal by a narrow margin on Friday, following Senate Democrats who in the wee hours of the morning won a procedural vote setting the stage for passage of the president's relief bill.<br /><br />AFP <br>
