           The first Arab space mission, the UAE's "Hope" probe, is expected to reach Mars' orbit on Tuesday, making it the first of three spacecraft to arrive at the Red Planet in February.<br /><br />The United Arab Emirates, China and the US all launched projects to Mars in July 2020, taking advantage of a period when the Earth and Mars are nearest.<br /><br />

The process, which will consume half of its fuel, will begin on Tuesday at 1530 GMT and it will take 11 minutes for a signal on its progress to reach ground control.<br /><br />Omran Sharaf, the UAE mission's project manager, said it was a "huge honor" to be the first of 2021's missions to reach Mars.<br /><br />"It is humbling to be in such auspicious and skilled company as we all embark on our missions," he said. "It was never a race for us. We approach space as a collaborative and inclusive effort."<br /><br />While the "Hope" probe is designed to provide a comprehensive image of the planet's weather dynamics, it is also a step toward building a human settlement on Mars within 100 years.<br /><br />While cementing its status as a key regional player, the UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of inspiration for Arab youth, in a region too often wracked by sectarian conflicts and economic crises. <br>
