           The US Department of Justice dropped its lawsuit accusing Yale University of discriminating against Asian and white applicants in undergraduate admissions, as the debate over affirmative action in higher education heads for a possible showdown at the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Wednesday's voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit, which had been brought by the Trump administration, followed a November 12, 2020 decision by a federal appeals court that Harvard University's use of race in undergraduate admissions complied with federal civil rights law.<br /><br />

He said the department, now under the Biden administration, will review the matter through its administrative process. <br /><br />In a letter to the Yale community, the university's president Peter Salovey welcomed the decision, saying that Yale was committed to an academic environment "built on a wide range of strengths and backgrounds," and confident its admissions process "complies fully with decades of Supreme Court decisions."<br /><br />The Ivy League school had been accused of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with policies that left Asian-Americans and whites one-eighth to one-fourth as likely to win admission as comparable blacks. <br>
