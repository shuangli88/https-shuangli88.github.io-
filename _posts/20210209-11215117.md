           Pope Francis has broken with Catholic tradition to appoint a woman as an undersecretary of the synod of bishops, the first to hold the post with voting rights in a body that studies major questions of doctrine.<br /><br />Frenchwoman Nathalie Becquart is one of the two new undersecretaries named Saturday to the synod, where she has been a consultant since 2019.<br /><br />

With the nomination of Sister Nathalie Becquart and her possibility of participating in voting, a door has opened," Grech said.<br /><br />The synod is led by bishops and cardinals who have voting rights and also comprises experts who cannot vote, with the next gathering scheduled for autumn 2022.<br /><br />A special synod on the Amazon in 2019 saw 35 female "auditors" invited to the assembly, but none could vote.<br /><br />The Argentinian-born pope has signaled his wish to reform the synod and to have women and laypeople play a greater role in the church.<br /><br />He named Spaniard Luis Marin de San Martin as the other under undersecretary in the synod of bishops.<br /><br />Becquart, 52, a member of the France-based Xaviere Sisters, has a master's degree in management from the prestigious HEC business school in Paris and studied in Boston before joining the order. <br>
