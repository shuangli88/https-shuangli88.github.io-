Photo: Xinhua </p>Japan was expected to extend a state of emergency on Tuesday to fight the spread of COVID-19 for Tokyo and other areas, three sources with knowledge of the legal procedures said Monday.<br /><br />The government was expected to decide on the extension after a meeting of its experts panel on Tuesday, with the emergency period in prefectures including the Tokyo area expected to run for another month, the sources said.<br /><br />Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was expected to hold a news conference on Tuesday, one source told Reuters.<br /><br />The government in January declared a one-month state of emergency, due to end on Sunday, for 11 areas here, including Tokyo and its neighboring prefectures, as part of measures to rein in the pandemic.<br /><br />Suga has launched a raft of measures to contain a third wave of infections as his government remains determined that the Olympics go ahead as planned on July 23.<br /><br />But support for his administration has weakened over unhappiness with its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent.<br /><br />The government may also consider lifting the state of emergency in some less-populated areas, such as Tochigi Prefecture, which has seen a decline in COVID-19 cases, local media said.<br /><br />A Nikkei newspaper poll showed 90 percent of respondents favored extending the emergency period in areas where it is implemented.<br /><br />Japan has had a total of 390,687 coronavirus cases and 5,766 deaths, public broadcaster NHK said.<br /><br />Reuters <br>
