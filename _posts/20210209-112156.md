AstraZeneca, which is developing a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in partnership with the University of Oxford, on Wednesday put on hold the phase-3 trial of its vaccine following an unexplained illness in one trial participant in Britain.

The government had intended to roll them out to healthcare workers this week.<br /><br />Scientists at the briefing said the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was effective against the new variant found in South Africa.<br /><br />Mkhize said an update would be given as for when this vaccine would arrive in the country. He also said the government was holding talks with a number of manufacturers and vaccines from different countries were being considered. Enditem <br>
