Who has been on the frontline since the beginning (of the outbreak)? Health workers (...) I am proud to represent my sector. I lost eight friends in the pandemic," Calazans, a nurse working at the Emilio Ribas Public Hospital in Sao Paulo, told Xinhua. <br /><br />The two women were inoculated at the Hospital de Clinicas after the CoronaVac and AstraZeneca vaccines were authorized for emergency use by the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency. <br /><br />"I feel very good, without adverse reactions. I had no sneezing nor cough. I also had no pain in my arm, where it was applied. My routine remained the same. I didn't have to stop working, so I'm sure that the vaccine is reliable," Calazans said. <br /><br />Kaimbe, a member of the Kaimbe community of the state of Bahia, was the first indigenous woman in Brazil to be vaccinated. The woman, a nursing technician, has dedicated herself to guaranteeing the indigenous people access to healthcare. <br /><br />"I was concerned from the beginning, considering that one of the risky groups for any viral disease is indigenous people," she told Xinhua. <br /><br />"We were the first to be vaccinated, as we are a group at risk for respiratory diseases. I told my people that the vaccine was the best we could get, and that we have to believe in science to curb extremely high mortality," she added. <br /><br />Encouraging others to get vaccinated is "a noble cause," she said. "There are families that are being decimated by this virus." <br>
