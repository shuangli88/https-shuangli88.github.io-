UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday strongly condemned Sunday's terrorist attack and killing of 11 coal miners in the Balochistan province of Pakistan, said his deputy spokesman.

Guterres extended his sincere condolences to the families of the miners and the people and government of Pakistan. He believed the Pakistani authorities will do everything possible to bring the perpetrators of this terrorist act to justice, said Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesman, in a statement.

Militants in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province attacked the camp of the coal miners and killed 11 of them. The victims were of the Hazara community, an ethnic minority, said a spokesman of the provincial government on Sunday.
