In this sense, the donation of the vaccines is a new testament to the iron friendship and close cooperation between the two countries and peoples," he added. <br /><br />Speaking at the handover ceremony, Wang said Cambodia is one of the first countries to receive the vaccine assistance from China and that the donation clearly showed China's commitment to making its COVID-19 vaccines global public goods. <br /><br />"It is hoped that these vaccines can play a positive role in helping Cambodia to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic," Wang said. <br /><br />China's Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine has been recognized as a safe and effective vaccine, ordered and approved for use in many countries, Hun Sen has said. <br /><br />He has said a vaccination drive against COVID-19 will be launched in Cambodia on Feb. 10 with the country's medical workers, armed forces members, teachers, journalists, tuk-tuk and taxi drivers, and garbage collectors being among the first people to take shots. <br /><br />Cambodian authorities have authorized the emergency use of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in the country, noting that "the vaccine is used safely in China and other countries." <br /><br />Cambodia has so far reported 474 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with zero deaths and 454 recoveries. <br>
