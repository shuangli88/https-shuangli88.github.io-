Its production is expected to start in the fall this year as the global market is contending with delivery delays and protectionist measures. <br /><br />"This is a major step forward to get vaccines made in Canada, for Canadians. We need as much domestic capacity for vaccine production as possible," Trudeau said at a press conference in Ottawa. "We won't rest until every Canadian who wants a vaccine has received one." <br /><br />Last summer, Trudeau announced more than 125 million Canadian dollars (97.7 million US dollars) to upgrade the National Research Council facility to produce vaccines domestically and avoid the global scramble for shots. <br /><br />Trudeau pointed that more contagious COVID-19 variants now taking hold in Canada mean tough rules must be implemented in the next few weeks. "These new variants out there are of real concern." <br /><br />

"We need to be very vigilant and very cautious about relaxation of those public health measures." <br /><br />Over the past seven days, an average of 4,368 new COVID-19 cases have been reported daily across Canada, a nearly 50 percent drop from three weeks ago, Tam said. <br /><br />Hospitalizations are also on the decline, falling 12 percent over the past week to fewer than 3,900 patients in care. Fatal cases have fallen by 20 percent to 128 deaths per day. <br /><br />As of Tuesday afternoon, Canada reported a cumulative total of 785,494 cases and 20,186 deaths, according to CTV. <br>
