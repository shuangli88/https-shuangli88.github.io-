Photo: AFP</p>Haitian authorities said Sunday they had foiled an attempt to murder President Jovenel Moise and overthrow the government, as a dispute rages over when his term ends.<br /><br />The plot was an "attempted coup d'etat," according to Justice Minister Rockefeller Vincent, with authorities saying at least 23 people have been arrested, including a top judge and an official from the national police.<br /><br />"I thank my head of security at the palace. The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life," Moise said.<br /><br />"That plan was aborted," he added, speaking on the tarmac at Port-au-Prince airport, accompanied by his wife and Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe.<br /><br />Jouthe said plotters had contacted police officers at the presidential palace who were planning to arrest Moise and then help install a "transition" president.<br /><br />Leon Charles, director of Haiti's national police force, said officers had seized documents, cash and several weapons.<br /><br />Jouthe added that among the documents was a speech from the judge who had planned on becoming interim leader in a transition government. But political opposition figures dismissed claims that a coup had been attempted.<br /><br />"You don't carry out a coup with two pistols and three or four rifles," lawyer Andre Michel told AFP.<br /><br />He added that Moise could not claim to have suffered a coup attempt because his presidential term had expired.<br /><br />Moise has been governing without any checks on his power for the past year and says he remains president until February 7, 2022 - in an interpretation of the constitution rejected by the opposition, which has led protests asserting that his term ended Sunday.<br /><br />AFP <br>
